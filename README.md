<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Problem Statement

### About

`Titanic Data EDA` is a Python challenge that seeks to uncover data trends in a snippet of the Titanic dataset. This project restricts itself to just EDA and data visualization.

### Data Source & Cleaning

The data is obtained from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) source and then snipped to be suitable for this EDA project.

Data cleaning consisted of removing nulls and feature extraction (creating family count, reverend status, port of embarkation, gender, and titles).

### Conclusion

From the barcharts above, it seems like Titanic survival was influenced by several factors. Namely: as your wealth (class) increased, was female, was younger, and had between 1-3 other family members on board, you were more likely to survive.
